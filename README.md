# Hi, Iâ€™m Nicola! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m a software developer mainly focused on TypeScript/JavaScript for frontend and backend development. I work with frameworks like React, NestJS, Fastify, and Express, and Iâ€™m actively growing my skills in Go through practical projects and contributions.  

Iâ€™m currently working in the advertising sector, always looking to improve my knowledge and tools, including Python for machine learning and security, and AWS certifications in progress.
